# Task Contract for Ethereum Network

Simple contract which allows to create a task for yourself and collect ether from supporters. Each supporter can downvote the task if for some reason they think the cause is no longer worthy or they just don't like the way the task is fulfilled. An owner of the contract can define a proportion of support which leads to the contract termination.
